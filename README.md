A web application that allows users to list spaces they have available, and to hire spaces for the night.

2. Any signed-up user can list a new space.
3. Users can name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
4. Users can offer a range of dates where their space is available.
5. Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night.
